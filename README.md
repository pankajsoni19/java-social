The project is a home grown demo for a simple http/https server written entirely in java. 

This has examples for smtp mail sending, talking to cassandra in CQL V3, working on oracle jdk7 http/s server at:
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/jre/api/net/httpserver/spec/com/sun/net/httpserver/package-summary.html

The settings are in conf folder and it uses logger to log comments.

Main class is in bootup.java (there is graceful shutdown, ctrl+c).

As this is a demo for server load capability, I have not updated all the html files with all menu options, neither condensed them.
